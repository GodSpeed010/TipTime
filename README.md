## Notes

My next project in the Google's *Android Basics in Kotlin* course was a Tip Calculator that looks very similar to this. Rather than following the given step-by-step tutorial, I decided to create the app on my own using what I learned so far in the book, *Heads First Android Development*. Overall, it was very enjoyable and a great learning experience for me as I had to figure out many things on my own for this project.
